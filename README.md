Disease Predictor Based On Symptoms
This is a simple python application that predicts disease based on the symptoms given by the user. The back-end used here is Oracle DB.
Only the administrator will be able to manage and make changes to the DB and the user can only use the application to view the diseases based on the symptoms given by him/her. The disease along with some other details like causes, prevention measures etc are also displayed in a table format on the screen.

Future Enhancement:
This application can be made into a real time application that uses machine learning concepts instead of storing them in a DB and so can analyse the symptoms and can interact with the user and work like a medical assistant.
